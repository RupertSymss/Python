    "Computer programs that we write which is a high level language needs to be understood by the computer and executed. However the computer does not understand our language needs to have it converted to machine code so that it can execute it. This task of converting a high level programming language into machine code can be done either by an \"Interpreter\" or a \"Compiler\". However they both function in different ways.\n",

    "Defition of a COMPILER: A compiler converts all lines of instructions in the source code at once into machine code (binary) and makes a copy of the source code file as a machine code file. Now the machine code file containing all the instructions in machine code can be shared and used independent of the source code file. Thus converting to machine code using the compiler is a one time task and it is no longer required during execution of the machine code and instead the machine code is distributed to end users as an executable. This machine code file executes much faster however the end user has no ability to change the machine code on the fly while it is being executed.\n",

    "Definition of an INTERPRETER: A interpreter converts one line at a time into machine code and send it for execution. Thus the interpreter is continously required to be available to convert each line of source code into machine code once the previous line of converted machine code has been executed. No separate machine code executable is created and instead the source code is shared among end users.  This is much slower to run as the machine has to wait for the next line of code while it is being converted by the interpreter. However the end user has much more control over the process (and also easier to debug) as they can modify the subsequent lines of source code before they get executed."
